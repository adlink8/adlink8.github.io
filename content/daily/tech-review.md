While many prefer cutting corners for instant gratification, I'm  doubling down on the underlying architecture. For me slow is faster in the long run.

My journey is divided into Four distinct phase, evolving form Linux and Python-based automation to Multi-cloud orchestration and Observability.

### Milestone 1

Linux internals and system calls to build the core collector.

### Milestone 2

Embrace containerization to package the app

### Milestone 3

Deploy to Multi-cloud (AWS & DigitalOcean) using Terraform.
